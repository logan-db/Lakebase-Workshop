# Lakebase Autoscaling Workshop

A hands-on workshop for exploring **Databricks Lakebase Autoscaling** -- a fully managed PostgreSQL database that runs inside your Databricks workspace.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the repo and run setup

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd Lakebase-Workshop
bash setup.sh
```

The setup script will walk you through everything: installing dependencies, connecting to your Databricks workspace, and deploying the workshop content. Just follow the prompts.

### Step 2: Run the setup notebook

In your Databricks workspace, open the **`00_Setup_Lakebase_Project`** notebook and click **Run All**.

This creates your personal Lakebase database and loads sample data. It takes about 2-3 minutes.

You can find the notebook at:
**Workspace > Users > *your email* > .bundle > lakebase-workshop > dev > files > notebooks**

### Step 3: Start exploring

You're all set. Pick any lab from the list below and dive in. Each lab is self-contained -- no need to follow a specific order.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **A Databricks workspace** with Lakebase Autoscaling enabled (your facilitator will confirm this)
- **Python 3** installed on your computer (most Macs have this already -- check by running `python3 --version` in your terminal)

The setup script handles everything else, including the Databricks CLI.

## Choose a Lab

Every lab is independent. Pick whichever sounds interesting, or follow one of the suggested tracks below.

### Application Builders

*Building apps, APIs, or AI agents? Start here.*

| Lab | What You'll Do |
|-----|----------------|
| **Data Operations** | Create, read, update, and delete data; work with JSON and arrays |
| **Agentic Memory** | Store and query AI agent conversation history |
| **App Deployment** *(capstone)* | Deploy a full-stack web app backed by Lakebase |

### Data & ML Engineers

*Working with data pipelines or machine learning? Start here.*

| Lab | What You'll Do |
|-----|----------------|
| **Reverse ETL** | Sync your Delta Lake tables into Lakebase for fast lookups |
| **Online Feature Store** | Serve ML features in real time from Lakebase |
| **Observability** | Monitor database performance and query activity |

### Platform Architects

*Evaluating Lakebase for your infrastructure? Start here.*

| Lab | What You'll Do |
|-----|----------------|
| **Development Experience** | Create isolated database branches, test autoscaling |
| **Authentication** | Explore token-based auth and role permissions |
| **Backup & Recovery** | Try point-in-time recovery and instant snapshots |

All labs are in the `labs/` folder, organized by topic.

## Lab Console App

Your facilitator may have deployed a shared **Lab Console** web app. This app mirrors all the labs in a visual interface -- you can use it alongside (or instead of) the notebooks.

Open it at: **Compute > Apps > lakebase-lab-console**

The setup notebook (Step 2 above) automatically grants the app access to your database, so it will show your data as soon as you log in.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| `setup.sh` fails during login | Run `databricks auth login --host <your-workspace-url> --profile lakebase-workshop` manually |
| Setup notebook hangs on "Waiting for endpoint" | This is normal -- it can take 2-3 minutes. Let it finish. |
| "password authentication failed" | Your database token expired (they last 1 hour). Re-run the connection cell in your notebook. |
| Lab Console shows "Project Not Found" | You haven't run the setup notebook yet. Go back to Step 2. |
