# MAGIC # Observability & Monitoring
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Path:** Observability &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Prerequisite:** `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Lakebase features:** pg_stat views, index analysis, connection monitoring, workspace UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook you will:
# MAGIC 1. Query `pg_stat_user_tables` for table-level activity
# MAGIC 2. Analyze index usage and identify unused indexes
# MAGIC 3. Monitor active connections and session state
# MAGIC 4. Check cache hit ratios and I/O performance
# MAGIC 5. Identify slow query patterns
# MAGIC 6. Learn where to find the Lakebase monitoring dashboard in the workspace
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Run `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project` first.** Running `labs/data-operations/Data_Operations` first
# MAGIC for more interesting metrics.

# MAGIC ### Key Metrics to Watch
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Metric | Healthy | Warning |
# MAGIC |--------|---------|---------|
# MAGIC | **Cache hit %** | > 99% | < 95% — data doesn't fit in RAM |
# MAGIC | **Rollbacks** | Near 0 | High ratio vs commits = app errors |
# MAGIC | **Temp files** | 0 | > 0 — queries spilling to disk, need more RAM or query tuning |

# MAGIC ## 7. Lakebase Monitoring in the Workspace UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In addition to these SQL-level metrics, Databricks provides a
# MAGIC **monitoring dashboard** in the workspace UI:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to **Catalog → Lakebase** (or **Compute → Lakebase**)
# MAGIC 2. Select your project
# MAGIC 3. Click the **Monitoring** tab
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The UI shows:
# MAGIC - **Compute utilization** — current CU usage and autoscaling events
# MAGIC - **Connection count** — active connections over time
# MAGIC - **Query throughput** — queries per second
# MAGIC - **Storage usage** — data size across branches
# MAGIC - **Branch activity** — which branches are active vs. suspended
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is especially useful during load tests (notebook 04 + the Lab Console
# MAGIC app) to watch autoscaling respond to traffic in real time.
