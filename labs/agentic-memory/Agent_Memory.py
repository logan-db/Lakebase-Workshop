# MAGIC # AI Agent Memory with Lakebase
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Path:** Agentic Memory &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Prerequisite:** `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Lakebase feature:** Short-term and long-term memory for AI agents
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Memory lets AI agents remember information from earlier in a conversation
# MAGIC or from previous conversations. Lakebase provides a fully managed Postgres
# MAGIC backend for both types of memory — no extra infrastructure needed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook you will:
# MAGIC 1. Understand short-term vs. long-term memory
# MAGIC 2. Build **short-term memory** — store and retrieve thread-based conversations
# MAGIC 3. Build **long-term memory** — extract and persist knowledge across sessions
# MAGIC 4. Query both memory layers using SQL
# MAGIC 5. Learn how to connect this to real agent frameworks (LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Run `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project` first** (the memory tables are created by the seed script in **your PostgreSQL schema**, resolved via `search_path` from `_setup`).

# MAGIC ## Agent Memory Architecture
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Agents use **two layers** of memory backed by Lakebase:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | | Short-term memory | Long-term memory |
# MAGIC |---|---|---|
# MAGIC | **What** | Entire conversation threads | Key-value pairs of extracted knowledge |
# MAGIC | **Scope** | Single session (thread ID) | Across all sessions for a user |
# MAGIC | **Stored as** | Ordered messages with roles | Topic → memory key-value pairs |
# MAGIC | **Use case** | Follow-up questions within a session | Personalization, preferences, learned facts |
# MAGIC | **Backed by** | `agent_sessions` + `agent_messages` tables | `agent_memory_store` table |

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Architecture Diagram
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The diagram below shows how the two memory layers work together:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Short-term memory** (left) — entire conversations stored in Lakebase,
# MAGIC   keyed by Thread ID. The agent reads these messages to maintain context
# MAGIC   within a session.
# MAGIC - **Long-term memory** (right) — key information extracted from multiple
# MAGIC   conversations and stored as key-value pairs. Agents access both layers
# MAGIC   to provide personalized, context-aware responses.
# MAGIC - Both memory layers are backed by Lakebase tables — the same managed
# MAGIC   Postgres your application already uses.

# MAGIC ## Part 1: Short-Term Memory
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Short-term memory captures context within a **single conversation session**
# MAGIC using thread IDs and message ordering. This is the foundation for multi-turn
# MAGIC chat — the agent can refer back to earlier messages in the same thread.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The pattern uses two tables:
# MAGIC - **`agent_sessions`** — one row per conversation thread (thread ID, agent config, metadata)
# MAGIC - **`agent_messages`** — ordered messages within each thread (role, content, timestamp)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### 1.2 Store a Multi-Turn Conversation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each message is stored with its role (`system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`)
# MAGIC and a timestamp. The agent reconstructs context by reading messages in order.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### 1.4 Checkpoint Pattern
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In production, frameworks like **LangGraph** use checkpointing to save
# MAGIC the full agent state (not just messages) after each step. Lakebase serves
# MAGIC as the checkpoint backend — the `agent-langgraph-advanced` template
# MAGIC demonstrates this pattern with LangGraph's built-in `PostgresSaver`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```python
# MAGIC from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
# MAGIC
# MAGIC checkpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(connection_string)
# MAGIC graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Each invocation automatically saves state to Lakebase
# MAGIC result = graph.invoke(input, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "my-thread"}})
# MAGIC ```

# MAGIC ## Part 2: Long-Term Memory
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Long-term memory **extracts key information** from multiple conversations
# MAGIC and stores it as key-value pairs. This allows agents to personalize
# MAGIC interactions based on past preferences and build knowledge about users
# MAGIC that improves responses over time.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The `agent_memory_store` table stores knowledge as:
# MAGIC - **`user_id`** — whose knowledge this belongs to
# MAGIC - **`topic`** — the key (e.g., "preferred_language", "team", "data_platform")
# MAGIC - **`memory`** — the extracted value

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### 2.1 Extract and Store Knowledge

# MAGIC In a real agent, an LLM extracts key facts from conversations
# MAGIC automatically. Here we simulate that extraction — imagine the agent
# MAGIC learned these facts from the conversation above.

# MAGIC ### Framework Integration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks provides pre-built app templates that implement both memory
# MAGIC layers with popular agent frameworks:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Framework | Template | Memory Types |
# MAGIC |-----------|----------|-------------|
# MAGIC | **LangGraph** | `agent-langgraph-advanced` | Short-term (checkpointing) + Long-term (Lakebase store) |
# MAGIC | **OpenAI Agents SDK** | `agent-openai-advanced` | Short-term (conversation history in Lakebase) |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```bash
# MAGIC # Clone a template to get started
# MAGIC git clone https://github.com/databricks/app-templates.git
# MAGIC cd app-templates/agent-langgraph-advanced
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Why Lakebase for Agent Memory?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Benefit | Details |
# MAGIC |---------|---------|
# MAGIC | **No extra infrastructure** | Same managed Postgres your app already uses |
# MAGIC | **ACID transactions** | Memory updates are atomic — no partial writes |
# MAGIC | **SQL queryable** | Debug, audit, and analyze agent behavior with standard SQL |
# MAGIC | **Branching** | Test memory schemas on a dev branch before touching production |
# MAGIC | **Scale-to-zero** | Dev/test memory stores cost nothing when idle |
