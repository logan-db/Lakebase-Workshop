# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Path:** Development Experience &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Prerequisite:** `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Lakebase feature:** Copy-on-write database branching
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook you will:
# MAGIC 1. List existing branches on your project
# MAGIC 2. Create an isolated development branch
# MAGIC 3. Make schema changes on the branch without affecting production
# MAGIC 4. Inspect the branch and clean up
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Run `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project` first.** Connections use your schema via `search_path`; SQL below uses unqualified names.

# MAGIC ## 1. List Branches
# MAGIC Every project starts with a `production` branch (the default).

# COMMAND ----------

branches = list(w.postgres.list_branches(parent=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}"))
for b in branches:
    bid = b.name.split("/")[-1]
    default = " (default)" if getattr(b.status, "default", False) else ""
    protected = " (protected)" if getattr(b.status, "is_protected", False) else ""
    print(f"  {bid}{default}{protected}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 2. Create a Development Branch
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This creates an instant, isolated copy of the production database.
# MAGIC The copy uses **copy-on-write** storage — no data is duplicated until
# MAGIC you make changes. We set a 24-hour TTL so it auto-deletes.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## 3. Connect to the Dev Branch
# MAGIC Each branch has its own compute endpoint. Let's connect and make
# MAGIC schema changes that are **completely isolated from production**.

# COMMAND ----------

time.sleep(10)

print("✓ Connected to dev branch")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 4. Make Changes on the Dev Branch
# MAGIC Add a `reviews` table — this only exists on the dev branch.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## 5. Verify Isolation
# MAGIC The reviews table exists on `lab-dev-01` but **not** on `production`.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 6. Clean Up (Optional)
# MAGIC Delete the dev branch when you're done. Or leave it — the 24h TTL
# MAGIC will auto-delete it.

# COMMAND ----------

# UNCOMMENT TO DELETE NOW:
# conn.close()
# w.postgres.delete_branch(name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/branches/{DEV_BRANCH}").wait()
# print(f"✓ Branch {DEV_BRANCH} deleted")
