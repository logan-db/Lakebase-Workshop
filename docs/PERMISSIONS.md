# Permissions Guide

## Shared App Architecture

The Lab Console runs as a **single shared Databricks App** (`lakebase-lab-console`).
When a user opens the app, it reads their email from the Databricks Apps proxy headers
and routes them to their own Lakebase project. All SDK calls and database connections
are performed by the app's **Service Principal** (SP).

## Two-Step Permission Model

The app requires two things to work:

### 1. SP gets the `postgres` OAuth scope (facilitator — once)

The app declares a `postgres` resource in `app.yaml`. After deployment, the facilitator
attaches their Lakebase project to this resource (done automatically by `setup.sh`).
This gives the SP the `postgres` OAuth scope, which is required for Lakebase SDK calls
like `list_endpoints` and `generate_database_credential`.

### 2. Each user grants the SP access to their project (per-user — once)

Each participant runs Step 6 in `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project` (or the equivalent cells
in the App Deployment lab). This:

1. Looks up the app's SP client_id
2. Creates a PostgreSQL OAuth role for the SP: `SELECT databricks_create_role('<SP_CLIENT_ID>', 'service_principal')`
3. Grants schema access: `GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA ... TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>"`

## What Each User Needs

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Workspace access** | User must be able to access the Databricks workspace and the app |
| **Lakebase project** | User must have run `00_Setup_Lakebase_Project` to create their project |
| **SP grant** | User must have completed Step 6 in setup (or the App Deployment lab) |

## How Authentication Works

### Request Flow

1. User opens the Lab Console app in their browser
2. Databricks Apps proxy authenticates the user via workspace SSO
3. Proxy injects `X-Forwarded-Email` into every request
4. The FastAPI backend reads this header and:
   - Derives the project ID from the email: `lakebase-lab-<sanitized-username>`
   - Derives the schema: `lakebase_lab_<sanitized_username>`
   - Uses the app's SP (`WorkspaceClient()`) to call Lakebase SDK
   - Generates a database credential via `w.postgres.generate_database_credential()`
   - Connects to PostgreSQL using the SP's client_id as username

### Two Permission Layers

Lakebase has two independent permission layers:

1. **Workspace permissions** — the SP needs access to each user's Lakebase project.
   Since projects are governed by Unity Catalog, the SP is granted access when
   each user runs the setup notebook.
2. **Database permissions** — the SP needs a PostgreSQL role with schema grants.
   This is handled by `databricks_create_role` + `GRANT` in the setup notebook.

### Why Not User Token Passthrough?

The Databricks Apps proxy forwards a user token (`x-forwarded-access-token`), but
this token **does not include the `postgres` OAuth scope**. Without this scope,
Lakebase SDK calls fail. The SP approach works because the postgres resource
declaration in `app.yaml` gives the SP the required scope.

### Local Development Fallback

When running the app locally (outside the Databricks Apps runtime), the forwarded
headers are not available. In this case, the app falls back to:

- Environment variables: `LAKEBASE_USER_EMAIL`, `LAKEBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `LAKEBASE_SCHEMA`
- Default Databricks SDK authentication (from `~/.databrickscfg`)

## Control Plane Permissions (Branch/Endpoint Management)

The app uses the SP for SDK calls (branch create/delete, endpoint management).
The SP is granted project-level access during the setup notebook, so Branch Manager
and Compute tabs work for any user who has completed the setup.

## Synced Table Permissions

Synced tables (Reverse ETL) are created by the Lakebase sync pipeline. The SP
needs access to the synced table's schema, which is covered by the schema-level
grants in the setup notebook.
